# Section 1: Python Basics for ML

This section covers fundamental Python concepts essential for Machine Learning and Data Science.

## 📚 Contents

### 1.1 Variables & Data Types (`01-variables-datatypes.py`)
- Integer, Float, String, Boolean, None types
- Type checking and conversion
- ML-specific use cases for each type
- Variable naming conventions

### 1.2 Lists (`02-lists.py`)
- Creating and accessing lists
- List methods (append, extend, insert, remove, pop, sort, etc.)
- List slicing and indexing
- List comprehensions
- Nested lists and multi-dimensional arrays
- Common ML use cases

### 1.3 Tuples (`03-tuples.py`)
- Creating and accessing tuples
- Immutability concept
- Tuple unpacking
- Use cases in ML (coordinates, RGB values, fixed configurations)
- Named tuples

### 1.4 Dictionaries (`04-dictionaries.py`)
- Creating and accessing dictionaries
- Dictionary methods (keys, values, items, get, update, etc.)
- Nested dictionaries
- Dictionary comprehensions
- ML applications (model configurations, hyperparameters)

### 1.5 Sets (`05-sets.py`)
- Creating sets
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)
- Set methods (add, remove, discard, etc.)
- Use cases in ML (unique labels, feature engineering)

### 1.6 Strings (`06-strings.py`)
- String creation and formatting
- String methods (split, join, replace, strip, etc.)
- String slicing and indexing
- f-strings and formatting
- Regular expressions basics
- Text preprocessing for NLP

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- ✅ Work with all basic Python data types
- ✅ Choose the appropriate data structure for different tasks
- ✅ Manipulate and transform data efficiently
- ✅ Apply these concepts to ML/Data Science problems

## 💡 Tips for Learning

1. **Run each file**: Execute each `.py` file to see the outputs
2. **Experiment**: Modify the examples and observe the results
3. **Practice**: Try solving small problems with each data structure
4. **ML Context**: Pay attention to ML-specific use cases in comments

## 📖 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Python 3.7+ installed
- A code editor or IDE (VS Code recommended)

## 🚀 Next Steps

After mastering these basics, you'll move to:
- Control Flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
